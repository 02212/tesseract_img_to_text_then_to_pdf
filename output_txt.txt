made up of various fees charged for my studies at the institution.

I am a registered university student who qualified for NSFAS funding but was either partially funded or not funded at all
in prior years. I understand that the Department of Higher Education and Training will be undertaking a verification check
on these amounts owed. The Department will pay off the debt owed for all legitimate tuition fees, university managed
accommodation fees and allowances, that supported me in my studies over the period I have been enrolled at the
institution and was a NSFAS beneficiary or NSFAS qualifying unfunded student. 1 will remain liable to pay any amounts
that were not part of my legitimate fees for tuition or accommodation, or allowances while a NSFAS beneficiary, as these
amounts would not have been covered by NSFAS funding in terms of their criteria.
